# Crime-Data-Analysis

This is my git repository for my crime analysis project! Thank you to Ken Jee for the inspiration on the project topic. He has been a big help to me throughout my data science journey and his link to his youtube channel is as follows: https://www.youtube.com/@KenJee_ds

## Data Sources

All of my CSV files were taken from the Fedral Bureau of Invesigation Crime Data Explorer. The link to the website is as follows: https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#

I decided to take the data on violent crime from 1990 all the way up to 2020. According to the FBI, "the descending order of violent crimes are homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, followed by the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft." The data shows total amounts of violent crime per 100,000 people, by year, as well as other statistics such as race, relationship, and weapon used.

It is important to note that the FBI is not including the 2,283 deaths that occured on September 11th, 2001. This is why we do not see a big spike in the data for 2001.
